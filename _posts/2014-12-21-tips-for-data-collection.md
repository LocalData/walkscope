### Not sure what to do? Take a look at the tips below!


### **Before you start**

If you are recording data in the field with a device such as a smart phone or tablet, make sure that your device is fully charged and that location services are enabled for both your device AND your browser.  WALKscope will work best if you close other applications and have plenty of free memory on your device.  The WALKscope web page may load slowly if you are in an area with poor reception.

### **The basics**

	1.	Move the map to the area where you would like to collect data.
	2.	Select a sidewalk (line) or intersection (circle).  The item you select will turn yellow.
	3.	Select the data you would like to record: sidewalk quality, intersection quality, or number of pedestrians.
	4.	Answer all of the questions as best you can.  It helps if you add a picture too!
	5.	Once you submit your answers, the sidewalk (line) or intersection (circle) will turn green.  
	6.	Select another sidewalk or intersection to record more data.

### **Moving the map**

There are a few different ways you can move the map:

	1.	Click on and drag the map.  You can also click on the plus (+) and minus (-) signs to zoom the map in and out.
	2.	Click on the menu button in the upper left corner (a circle with three horizontal lines).  Then you can:
		-	Click on the blue “Locate me” button to move the map to your current location.  
		-	Alternatively, enter an address in the orange box and click on the blue “Find address” button.
		-	Click on the map again to close the menu.

When you first open the map or move to new location, it may take a moment before the sidewalks (lines) and intersections (circles) appear on the map.

### **Sidewalk Quality**

**_What type of sidewalk?_**

Use your best guess for sidewalk width.  Attached sidewalks are directly adjacent to the street, whereas detached sidewalks have a strip of grass or other space between the sidewalk and the street. Some neighborhoods in Denver have narrow sidewalks with curbs designed to be easy to drive over.  For these, choose “less than 3 feet rollover curb.”

**_Are there obstructions any problems with the sidewalk?_**

An obstruction is anything that would prevent pedestrians from easily using the sidewalk. Examples might include trash or debris, overgrown plants, or utility poles. While you're at it, go ahead and tell us what the obstruction is in the description. A crack or uneven sidewalk is significant if it makes it unsafe or difficult for pedestrians. Ignore minor cracks or other abnormalities that don't affect sidewalk usage.

**_Do you feel unsafe? (lighting, traffic, or other)_**

Safety is important, but often hard to quantify. Sometimes low lighting or fast-moving traffic can trigger safety concerns, while other times the presence of lots of people or appropriate protection from traffic can offset those concerns. Use your best judgment and tell us more in the Description!

**_Pedestrian amenities_**

Shade trees, landscaping, benches, public art and other amenities make a nice, inviting place to walk.  Let us know in the description about the amenities you particularly like.

### **Intersection Quality**

**_Are there painted crosswalks?_**

Well-marked crosswalks increase visibility and contribute to pedestrian safety.  Be sure to note whether the crosswalks are in all crossing directions, or just some.

**_How many lanes are there to cross?_**

Count the number of lanes on the street with the most lanes. For instance, if one street had 4 lanes and the other had 7, the number of lanes recorded would be 7. You should also count turn lanes as lanes.

**_Are there traffic controls?_**

Some, but not all traffic lights also have signals specifically for pedestrians.  Some intersections may have pedestrian signals, but not traditional traffic lights.  Intersections with stop signs typically do not have traffic lights or pedestrian signals.

**_Are there pedestrian amenities?_**

Bulb-outs are an extension of the curb that shorten crossing distances.  Median islands provide a safe place for pedestrians to wait part way across the street.  Accessible curb ramps make it easy for people in wheelchairs to cross the street.

**_Are there problems with driver behavior?_**

Drivers that speed, run red lights or stop signs, or fail to yield to pedestrians create hazardous conditions for walking.  If you are familiar with the area, answer this question based on your general experience.  If you are not familiar with the area, answer this question based on your current observations.

### **Number of Pedestrians**

**_How many pedestrians did you count at this location?_**

Only count pedestrians on the same side of the street as you.

**_Is it raining or snowing?_**

If there's significant snow or ice on the ground, go ahead and choose snowing.

**_How long did you observe this street segment?_**

The longer you observe an area, the more useful the data is!
