### General Tips

**Deleting Points**

If you make a mistake and need to delete a point, just send us an email at: help@walkscope.org

**Geolocation**

The locate me button  allows you to automatically zoom to your current location. Make sure geolocation is enabled for your device AND for your browser. 

**Pedestrian Count**

_Is it raining or snowing?_

If there's significant snow or ice on the ground, go ahead and choose snowing.

**Sidewalk Quality**

_What type of sidewalk?_

Use your best guess for sidewalk width. Sometimes in Denver, we see narrow sidewalks with curbs that are designed for cars to drive onto for parking. For these, choose "Less than 3 feet rollover curb". Detached sidewalks have a strip of grass or other space between the sidewalk and the road, like this: 

_Are there obstructions in the sidewalk?_

Anything that would prevent pedestrians from easily using the sidewalk is an obstruction. Examples might include trash or debris, overgrown plants, or utility poles. While you're at it, go ahead and tell us what the obstruction is in the Description!

_Is the sidewalk significantly cracked or uneven?_

A crack or uneven sidewalk is significant if it makes it unsafe or difficult for pedestrians. Ignore minor cracks or other abnormalities that don't affect sidewalk usage.

_Do you feel unsafe? (lighting, traffic, or other)_

Safety is important, but often hard to quantify. Sometimes low lighting or fast-moving traffic can trigger of safety concerns, while other times the presence of lots of people or appropriate protection from traffic can offset those concerns. Use your best judgement and tell us more in the Description!

**Intersection Quality**

_How many lanes are there to cross?_

Count the number of lanes on the street with the most lanes. For instance, if one street had 4 lanes and the other had 7, the number of lanes recorded would be 7. You should also count turn lanes as lanes.
Are there median islands or bulb-outs?
